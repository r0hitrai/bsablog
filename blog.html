Today, the top five finalists of Google Play’s Change The Game Design Challenge are launching their games in the Play Store. While half of mobile game players are women, they only make up 23% of the gaming creator industry. This is what inspired Change The Game to put on a challenge that would bring the next generation of female gamer makers’ games to life. From a shape-shifting young girl navigating through the forest to an artist choosing the right color for their palette—these games were all imagined, written and developed by the winners of the Design Challenge.
